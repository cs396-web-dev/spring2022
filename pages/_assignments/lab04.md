## Overview / Set Up
The goal of this week's lab is to set up HW3 so that you're ready to work on HW3 in class next Monday. This will involve completing the following three parts of [Homework 3](hw03):

{:.compact}
1. [Introduction](hw03#webdev_1-introduction)
1. [Setting everything up](hw03#webdev_2-setting-everything-up)
1. [Background readings and concepts](hw03#webdev_3-background-readings-and-concepts)

## What to turn in
Please submit the following screenshots / documents in a zip file to get credit for today's lab:

{:.checkbox-list}
* Screenshot of your local API tester: [http://localhost:5000/api](http://localhost:5000/api)
* Screenshot of the output from your automated tests (failures=44, errors=11)
* Screenshot of your flask shell running **any of the sample SQLAlchemy commands** from the [background readings and concepts](hw03#webdev_3-background-readings-and-concepts) section (so that we can verify that your flask shell is working and successfully issuing queries to your database). Try all of the CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations for the `Post` model.
* A text file (word doc, pdf, txt, etc.) that answers the following questions in your own words (1-2 sentences is fine):
    * What is the value of SQLAlchemy?
    * What is a model?
    * What is a view?

> ### Note: Please be proactive about resolving installation issues
> If you run into issues installing the dependencies for HW3 (which is very common -- not to worry!), it is important that you make a plan to resolve these issues as soon as possible (for your own benefit / stress level). For you to get full credit for this lab, you may have a few extra days (until Tuesday at midnight) to go to office hours and get things working. That said, we will be working through HW3 in class starting next week, so do make this a priority!
