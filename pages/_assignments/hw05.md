## 1. Introduction
In this homework assignment, you are going to lock down your system so that only logged in users can interact with it. This includes three big categories of changes:

{:.compact}
1. Creating a new form and loging endpoint to handle authentication and issue a JWT (JSON Web Token).
2. Locking down all of your endpoints (from HW3) so that they require a valid JWT.
3. Updating your JavaScript file(s) (from HW4) so that they pass the authentication credentials to the API.

To do this, we will be using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). Please review the [Lecture 15](../lectures/lecture15) materials for the basic JWT workflow.

### 1. Cookies versus authorization headers
You can pass JWTs between the client and the server in a variety of different ways: through cookies, through custom HTTP headers, through the request body, and/or as query parameters. In this assignment, you will be two methods:
1. Within your web application interface, you will use an integrated approach that relies on a http-only JWT (cookie). In addition, to prevent CSRF attacks, all PATCH, POST, and DELETE requests coming from your JavaScript must also include a CSRF token in the header of the request.
2. Outside of your UI (e.g., if you're just interacting with a REST API Endpoint via Python), you will pass the JWT as a header, but will not need the CSRF token.

#### 1.1. The Cookie Approach (for Browser-Based Interactions)
1. Your Flask UI will rely on JWT cookies. You will write code to generate these cookies on the server. Subsequently, these cookies will sent back and forth between the browser and the server via request and response headers (respectively). 
2. The `flask-jwt-extended` library has a few convenience functions that will help you generate and set these cookies:

    {:.compact}
    * `create_access_token()` -- generates the token
    * `set_access_cookies()` -- sets the access cookies on the response header
3. Workflow:

    {:.compact}
    * User sends username and password to the server via a login form.
    * If the credentials are valid, the server sets the JWT tokens using cookies.
    * Because the JWT cookies are set, the system will know who is logged in.
    * When the JWT access token expires, the system redirects the user to the login screen.

#### 1.2. The HTTP Header Approach (for the REST API)
In the case of the REST API, your client may or may not be your Flask application. For instance, in HW3, the Python test suite and Postman were ***external clients***. But in HW4, the client was your `hw4.js` file, which *was* part of your UI.

##### Browser Clients
For internal clients that use your REST API, you need to embed something called an `X-CSRF-TOKEN` in the header of your fetch requests. Here is an example of how you might use fetch to access a protected REST Endpoint from within your UI (like you did in HW4):

```js
fetch("/api/posts", {
        method: "GET",
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'X-CSRF-TOKEN': '5c4f034d-13d6-4aa2-b686-ee0add18426b'
        }
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data);
    });
```

##### Non-Browser Clients
For external clients, you need to offer them another way to access your REST API without actually having to log into your UI. To do this, you will implement:

{:.compact}
* A way for a user to authenticate with the REST API order to receive an access and refresh token.
* Security measures on all of your REST API endpoints that require an access token.

Here is an example of how you might use fetch to access a protected resource from an ***external*** python app (or from Postman), using an access token:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    'http://localhost:5000/api/posts',
    headers={
        'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + access_token
    }
)
print('Status Code:', response.status_code)
print(response.json())
```


### 2. The Flask-JWT-Extended Library
To help you implement the JWT workflow, you will be using the `flask-jwt-extended` library, which offers some common JSON Web Token functionality that will help you. Please refer to the full documentation to get a more comprehensive explanation. Some links that we have found to be particularly helpful:

{:.compact}
* <a href="https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/en/latest/options/#general-options" target="_blank">Configuration options</a>
* <a href="https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/#verify-tokens-in-request" target="_blank">Verification & helper functionality</a>
* <a href="https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/en/latest/refreshing_tokens/" target="_blank">Refreshing tokens</a>

<!-- 
#### Cheatsheet
Below are some key pieces of functionality that will be important to you as you implement authentication:

{:.cheatsheet}
| Description | Code | Notes |
|--|--|--|--|
| **Configuration** | |  | |
| Access Token Expiration | `JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES` | defaults to 10 minutes |
| Refresh Token Expiration | `JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRES`| defaults to 30 days
| Secret (Salt for encryption algo) | `JWT_SECRET_KEY` | store in your .env file, not in your codebase |
| **Methods & Properties** | | | |
| Current User | `flask_jwt_extended.current_user` | property that stores a User object of the logged in user. Only works if you configure your "user_lookup_loader" (see below)|
| |  | |
| **Decorators** | | | |
| Current User function decorator | `@jwt.user_lookup_loader` | Decorator to be used to specify how the current user should be retrieved (given the identity info embedded in the token). |
 -->

## 2. Setup

### 1. Configure your local git repo
Before making any changes to your `photo-app` folder, let's create a snapshot of your current work (from HW04) by creating a `hw04` branch using git:

1. On your terminal or command line, navigate to your photo-app folder.
1. Using git, create a branch called hw04 as follows: `git checkout -b hw04`
1. Now type `git branch` and you should see several branches, including: `main` and `hw04`. Also note that you are currently on the `hw04` branch (it should be green with an asterik next to it).
1. Push your hw04 branch to GitHub as follows: `git push -u origin hw04`
1. Open GitHub in your web browser and verify that your hw04 branch is there.
1. Finally, on your local computer, switch back to your `main` branch (i.e., make `main` the active branch you're working on) by typing `git checkout main`.
1. Verify that you are on your `main` branch by typing `git branch` (you should see an asterik next to it).

### 2. Install dependencies:
* Install flask-jwt-extended using whatever method has worked for you in the past:<br> `pip3 install flask-jwt-extended`
* Add this line to your `requirements.txt` so that when you deploy your app to Heroku, it will also install the dependency on the Heroku container instance:<br> `Flask-JWT-Extended==4.3.1`

### 3. Create a new environment variable
In your `.env` file, add a new environment variable for your JWT secret. You can make this secret anything you want:

`JWT_SECRET=MY_SECRET`

### 4. Download & incorporate the starter files
Download hw05.zip and unzip it. 

<a class="nu-button" href="/spring2022/course-files/homework/hw05.zip">hw05.zip<i class="fas fa-download" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>

You should see a directory structure that looks like this:

```bash
hw05

    └── token.py
```

Please integrate the starter files as follows:

### Add (new files)

| File / Folder | What is this file? |
|--|--|
| `decorators.py` | Added a decorator whose job is to redirect to the login page if no credentials are found. |
| `views/authentication.py` | View that handles the login / logout form functionality. |
| `views/token.py` | API Endpoint that issues access / refresh token if authorized credentials are provided. |
| `tests_updated` (entire folder) | Updated tests that incorporate authentication. |
| `templates/login.html` | New Login form stub. |

### Replace

| File / Folder | What Changed? |
|--|--|
| `requirements.txt` | Added new library / dependency called `Flask-JWT-Extended` |
| `views/__init__.py` | `initialize_routes` function updated to include new routes (`/login`, `/logout`, `/api/token`, and `/api/token/refresh`). |
| `templates/api` (entire folder) | Now includes sample code for how to make requests with the authentication headers. |
| `templates/navbar.html` | Logout button now connected to logout route. |
| `static/js/api.js` | Fetch requests updated to include authentication token in the header. |
| `models/api_structure.py` | New routes (`/login`, `/logout`, `/api/token`, and `/api/token/refresh`) added to the tester. |


### Integrate
* `app_updates.py`

In regards to `app_updates.py`, you will integrate the following code into your `app.py` file as follows:

#### 1. At the top
At the top of your `app.py` file, where the import statements are, add the following:

```python
# new import statement:
import flask_jwt_extended
import decorators
```

#### 2. After the app variable is initialized
After your app variable is initialized, please configure the JWT authentication workflow by (1) updating some configuration settings, and (2) creating a function that figures out who is logged into the system. The following code does this:


```python
# new JWT configuration settings (after the app variable is initialized):
app.config["JWT_SECRET_KEY"] = os.environ.get('JWT_SECRET')
app.config["JWT_TOKEN_LOCATION"] = ["headers", "cookies"]
app.config["JWT_COOKIE_SECURE"] = False

# https://github.com/vimalloc/flask-jwt-extended/issues/308
app.config['PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS'] = True 
jwt = flask_jwt_extended.JWTManager(app)

```

#### 3. Delete User #12 Code

Please replace this code (where user #12 is hard-coded)...

```python
with app.app_context():
    app.current_user = User.query.filter_by(id=12).one()
```
...with this code (where the logged in user is determined via the JWT)...

```python
@jwt.user_lookup_loader
def user_lookup_callback(_jwt_header, jwt_data):
    # print('JWT data:', jwt_data)
    # https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/en/stable/automatic_user_loading/
    user_id = jwt_data["sub"]
    return User.query.filter_by(id=user_id).one_or_none()
```

#### 4. Update your routes
Finally, lock down your `/` endpoints in `app.py` by adding the `@decorators.jwt_or_login` decorator directy above the function definition. This will ensure that if your user isn't authenticated, they'll be redirected to the login screen:

```python
# Server-side template for the homepage:
@app.route('/')
@decorators.jwt_or_login
def home():
    # your code goes here...
```

Please also **replace** the `/api` function with the following code (which includes the necessary authentication information):

```python
@app.route('/api')
@app.route('/api/')
@decorators.jwt_or_login
def api_docs():
    access_token = request.cookies.get('access_token_cookie')
    csrf = request.cookies.get('csrf_access_token')
    navigator = ApiNavigator(flask_jwt_extended.current_user)
    return render_template(
        'api/api-docs.html', 
        user=flask_jwt_extended.current_user,
        endpoints=navigator.get_endpoints(),
        access_token=access_token,
        csrf=csrf,
        url_root=request.url_root[0:-1] # trim trailing slash
    )
```

{:.compact}
* Import statements at the top
* The rest after the `app` object has been initialized but before the `if __name__ == '__main__':`
* You may not want to copy over the new api_docs function 'til the very end.

### 5. Rebuild your database
When you're done, please rebuild your database `python3 populate.py` (or however you've done it in the past). There was a bug in how the passwords were hashed in the `users` table, which needs to be fixed for this assignment to work.

### 6. Run your old tests
Run your old tests (in the `tests` directory). They should all still pass). By the end of the assignment, all of the new tests (in the `tests_updated` directory) should pass.


## 3. Your Tasks
For this assignment, you will be implementing an authentication system for your REST API and for your app. There are 4 tasks you need to complete:

{:.compact}
1. [Securing the user interface](#ui)
1. [Deprecating the hard-coded reference to User #12](#deprecate)
1. [Securing the REST API](#rest)
1. [Deploying to Heroku](#heroku)


{:#ui}
### 1. Securing the User Interface (15 Points)
In order to implement authentication within your Photo App UI, you will:

            </td>
            <td>3</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

{:#deprecate}
### 2. Deprecating User #12 (5 Points)

Now that you've implemented a way for your user to log, you need display the logged in user's data. However, the way the application is currently configured, you're still displaying User #12. To fix this, you will need to deprecate `app.current_user`, which relies on the following code in `app.py`

```python
# set logged in user
with app.app_context():
    app.current_user = User.query.filter_by(id=12).one()
```

Luckily, the `flask-jwt-extended` library provides a way to do this. The approach:
1. Define a function that retrieves the User object based on the user_id that is embedded in the token.
2. Add the `@jwt.user_lookup_loader` decorator to the top of the function. By doing this, you can use the built-in `flask-jwt-extended.current_user` property to access the logged in user (works like magic).

**Sample code:**

First, define a function for retrieving a user from the database using the embedded JWT user_id:

```python
# defines the function for retrieving a user from the database
@jwt.user_lookup_loader
def user_lookup_callback(_jwt_header, jwt_data):
    # print('JWT data:', jwt_data)
    # https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/en/stable/automatic_user_loading/
    user_id = jwt_data["sub"]
    return User.query.filter_by(id=user_id).one_or_none()
```

When you're done, replace any instance of `app.current_user` with `flask_jwt_extended.current_user`. 

{:#rest}
### 3. Securing the REST API (15 Points)
You will make the following changes to your REST API in order to implement JWT authentication:

{:.compact}
1. Create an endpoint to issue a access / refresh token.
2. Create an endpoint to issue a new access token (using your refresh token).
3. Lock down all of your endpoints.

        <tr>
            <td>All routes</td>
            <td>
                Lockdown all endpoints. Every API endpoint in the system should now require a JWT token. Hint: use the <code>@jwt_required()</code> decorator from the flask-jwt-extended library. Ensure that all tests pass with the new test suite.
            </td>
            <td></td>
            <td>5</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

 
* When you're done with parts 1-3, all of the tests in `tests_updated` should pass (just run `run_tests.py`).

{:#heroku}
### 4. Deploying to Heroku (5 Points)
Please check in all of your changes / additional files to Git, and deploy your completed app to Heroku.
* Reminders:
    * You'll need to add a new environment variable to Heroku called `JWT_SECRET`. We recommend that you use the same secret locally and on Heroku. To add an environment variable, go to the settings tab of your app and click the "Reveal Config Vars" button.
    * Don't forget to update your requirements.txt with the new dependency you introduced: `Flask-JWT-Extended==4.3.1`.
    * Don't forget to rebuild your remote database because of the "password bug" in the previous version of `populate.py`. To do this, just change the DB_URL in your `.env` file so that it's pointing to your cloud database, and then run `python3 populate.py`. 
* If you already have your Heroku app set to auto-deploy, then your changes will automatically deploy once you push your changes to GitHub, and you therefore don't need to do anything.
* If your app is not set to auto-deploy, make sure to navigate to the "Deploy" tab and click the "Deploy" button.

## 4. What to Turn In
Please review the requirements above and ensure you have met them. Specifically:
