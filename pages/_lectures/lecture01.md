## Welcome to the Course!
Welcome! In this course, we will be connecting different servers and systems together to make an Instagram-like clone. This involves:

| 1. | Building a database | PostgreSQL |
| 2. | Using a "back-end" framework to allow your UI to communicate with your DB | Flask (Python) |
| 3. | Building a "Vanilla" web-based UI | HTML, CSS, and JavaScript |
| 4. | Using a "front-end" framework to better organize your UI | React |
| 5. | Using various cloud services to deploy your app | GitHub, Heroku, Heroku Postgres, and Amazon S3 |

Below is a conceptual diagram of what you will be building over the course of 10 weeks (with the exception of the grey boxes, which represent future work you might do). If you were hoping that this course would be more front-end / design-oriented, consider taking <a href="https://eecs130.github.io/spring2022/" target="_blank">CS130</a> instead. While it does not count for the CS Major, it gives a good overview of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some UX/UI design principles.
